          The palette alternates. A plum section, then a cream one, then plum
          again. That rhythm is the layout system as much as the colour system:
          it gives a long page a pulse without needing a single divider.

        <Prose>
          Mauve is the colour people recognise, and it only works on dark. On
          cream it measures 2.11:1 — far below the 4.5:1 that body text needs,
          and low enough that the text is genuinely hard to see rather than just
          low-contrast.
        </Prose>
        <Prose>
          Deep Mauve is the same role, redrawn for light surfaces at 7.22:1.
          They are two cuts of one accent, not two colours, which is why they
          are never used together.
