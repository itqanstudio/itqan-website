          Itqan Studio is named after a standard rather than a person or a
          place. Itqan means excellence in Arabic — the kind that comes from
          doing a thing thoroughly rather than fast. Naming the studio after it
          is a commitment that is easy to check: the work either meets it or it
          does not.

        When a design decision is genuinely close, the principle breaks the tie.
        If an option is more impressive but a principle says clarity, clarity
        wins — even when impressive would photograph better.
