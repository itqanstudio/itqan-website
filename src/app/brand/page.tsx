          A brand portal usually exists so a team stops asking which blue is the
          real blue. This one has a second job: the studio is named after a
          standard, and a standard nobody can check is just a claim. So
          everything here is specific enough to be held to.

        <Prose>
          Every colour carries a measured contrast ratio. Every asset comes
          straight from the working library rather than a list someone
          maintains by hand. If a page here disagrees with the product, the page
          is the bug.

          None of this was designed in the abstract. The palette, the type scale
          and the motion rules were all settled while building real things for
          real clients, and they are documented here in the form they survived
          in.
